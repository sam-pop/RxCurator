# RxCurator

[WIP] RxCurator is a full-stack react web app that let's you scan the barcodes of all the medicine you are regularly taking in order to maintain a detailed list of all your medication (so you can easily fill-out all those medical forms correctly) and with the ability to print / share it with your doctor's office or pre-op coordinator.
